## Project Insight :-

Tech Support Capacity:

- Current ticket volume per customer is higher than the target of 0.5. To reduce this, we could consider proactive troubleshooting resources and customer education programs to resolve common issues before they escalate to support.
Another suggestion is expanding the tech support team or improving ticket management workflows.

Sales of 1- and 2-Year Contracts:

- A 5% increase in 1- and 2-year contracts can be driven by offering promotions or discounts for longer-term contracts.
Improving customer communication and emphasizing the cost-saving benefits of these contracts can also help boost sales.

Automatic Payment Enrollment:

- To achieve the 5% yearly increase, we can introduce incentives like small discounts or rewards for customers who sign up for automatic payments.
Streamlining the enrollment process and promoting it through targeted emails and campaigns will also be key.
